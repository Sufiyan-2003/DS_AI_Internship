    "Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed with fixed rules. \n",
    "In traditional programming, we give the computer both the rules and the data to get results. But in Machine Learning, we provide data along with the correct answers, and the system automatically discovers the rules by identifying patterns. \n",
    "This allows machines to improve their performance over time and make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. For example, instead of manually writing rules to detect spam emails, a machine learning model learns from thousands of labeled emails and figures out what makes an email spam."
